What is a UMS? How does it help you to access all of the online services proposed by the university? How can you build your own UMS?
UMS (university management system) is an online platform which provides students the access to a wide range of services offered by the university. By the University it is used for administrative and communication purposes. Examples of services are - assignment download, assignment upload, RMS, fees status, placement drives, announcements and much more.
To access online services offered by University you must login into your UMS account using the credentials given by the University itself. After logging in a beautiful UI systems lists down all of the services available and the student can access any service/feature with just a click.  
Building a UMS is a time consuming and hard-working job. One must be well known with the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (for frontend). It is very important to use appropriate tags and styling to make the website look good and interactive.
